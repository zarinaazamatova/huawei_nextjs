# Working on a feature
- Select appropriate branch purpose from the list: `feature`, `fix`, `test`, or `release`
- Everytime you work on a feature, create remote branch that follows the next pattern: `tag/HNJ-id-short-description`. For example, for the ticket https://zhyldyzargynbaeva.atlassian.net/browse/HNJ-1 it will be: `feature/HNJ-1-initializing-Nextjs-project`
